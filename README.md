## General Information
- This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a loan dataset to understand factors influencing loan defaults and identify patterns to minimize credit risk.
- Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers with investors, providing various loans including personal and business loans.
- Identifying factors that lead to loan defaults to minimize financial losses and avoid denying loans to creditworthy borrowers.
- The dataset used for this analysis is a Lending Club dataset containing various attributes of past loan applicants and their loan statuses.

## Conclusions
- Borrowers prefer moderate-sized loans.
- Most loans have interest rates between 7.5% and 15%, peaking around 10%.
- Loans are mostly given to lower-income individuals.
- Lower DTIs (0-20%) correlate with fewer defaults; higher DTIs (20-40%) correlate with more defaults.
- Loans are mainly given to borrowers with good credit scores (grades A, B, and C), who have lower default rates.
- Most loans are fully repaid, often linked with longer credit histories and lower DTIs.
- Borrowers in the West have higher default rates.
- Longer-term loans (60 months) have higher default rates than shorter-term loans (36 months).
